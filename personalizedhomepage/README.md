# Personalized Homepage

Samwell Tarly is helping people set up their homepages so that they
can increase their popularity and attract more people to fight against
the night king.

To do that, he has set up a Homepage Maker. Bran saw Samwell hiding something
in a file called flag.txt in his visions. Help Bran locate that file.

# Running Instructions

The directory structure should be maintained, with `webroot` being the php
root folder, and flag.txt being in the directory above it.
